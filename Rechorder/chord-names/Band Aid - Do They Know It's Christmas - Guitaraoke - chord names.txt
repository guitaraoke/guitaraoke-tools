It's Christmastime, there's no need to be afraid
            |F       |G                  |C              |
At Christmastime, we let in light and we banish shade
           |F       |G            |C                |F
And in our world of plenty we can spread a smile of joy
           |Dm             |G                |C          |
Throw your arms around the world at Christmastime
 
          |F     |G            |C                        |
But say a prayer, Pray for the other ones
            |F        |G                    |C           |
At Christmastime it's hard, but when you're having fun
          |F                 |G
There's a world outside your window
           |C                 |F
And it's a world of dread and fear
          |Dm        |G
Where the only water flowing
       |C              |F
Is the bitter sting of tears
        |Dm                  |G
And the Christmas bells that ring there
        |C                 |F
Are the clanging chimes of doom
       |Dm                  |G              |C           |
Well tonight thank God it's them instead of you
 
          |F               |G          |C                |
And there won't be snow in Africa this Christmastime
    |F                    |G               |C    |
The greatest gift they'll get this year is life, Ohhhh
      |F           |G
Where nothing ever grows
   |C              |F
No rain nor rivers flow
|Dm               |G               |C      |F   C
Do they know it's Christmastime at all?
 
|Am
Here's to you
|G
Raise a glass for everyone
|Am
Here's to them
|G
Underneath that burning sun
|F                |G
Do they know it's Christmastime at
