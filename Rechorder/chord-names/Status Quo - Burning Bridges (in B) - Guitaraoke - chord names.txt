   [Intro]

   [Verse 1]
B                             E    
Burning bridges never made me cry
C#m           C#                E   F#
I could walk away with no goodbye
B                            E   E5
Easy take or easy leave them all
C#m                   C#              E    F#
'til you scratch the writing on the wall
 
 
   [Chorus]
     E                   B    F#
It's on and off and on again
E            B
Going on and then
E
Taking all I got again
 B/Eb        C#         F#    F#7
Bleeding me leaving me dry 
       E                       B   F#
You're hanging on for what you can
 E               B
Dragging out the pain
E
Taking all I give again
B/Eb       C#        F#     F#7
Fakin it making me cry

   [Verse 2]
B                            E   E5
One day someday I may slide away
C#m              C#             E    F#
Turn around and call it all a day
B                               E     E5
Even though I fooled myself for years
C#m             C#                  E    F#
I can't escape this ringing in my ears
 
 
    [Chorus]
     E                   B    F#
It's on and off and on again
E            B
Going on and then
E
Taking all I got again
 B/Eb        C#         F#    F#7
Bleeding me leaving me dry 
       E                       B   F#
You're hanging on for what you can
 E               B
Dragging out the pain
E
Taking all I give again
B/Eb       C#        F#     F#7
Fakin it making me cry
