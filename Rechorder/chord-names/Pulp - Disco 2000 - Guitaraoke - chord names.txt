[Verse 1] (Intro riff played throughout verse)
 
F 
Well we were born within an hour of each other
F 
Our mothers said we could be sister and brother
Bb 
Your name is Deborah, Deborah 
Bb 

- it never suited you
F 
And they said that when we grew up
F
We'd get married and never split up
Bb
Oh we never did, although I often 
Bb 

thought of it

Oh Deborah, do you recall?
                      Cm 
Your house was very small
                            Cm 
With woodchip on the wall
                            Cm 
And when I came round to call
                       F
You didn't notice me at alllllllll
  
[Chorus]
 
              Bb
And I said, let's all meet up in the year 2000
Dm                                        Gm
won't it be strange when we're all fully grown?
                            Cm               F
Be there 2 o'clock by the fountain down the road
Bb
I never knew that you'd get married
Dm
I would be living down here on my own
         Gm                Cm              F
On that damp and lonely Thursday years ago
