[Chorus]
G                    A
East bound and down, loaded up and truckin'
  F         C                         D
a'we gonna' do what they say can't be done
            G                     A
We've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there
    F                D                  G
I'm east bound, just watch 'ole' Bandit run.

          Em                              C
Keep your foot hard on the peddle....son, never mind them brakes.....
       A                   B7                 Em
let it all hang out 'cause we've got a run to make
             Em                              C
The boys are thirsty in Atlanta, and there's beer in Texarkana
          A                               B7
and we'll bring it back no matter what it takes

We've got a long way to go, and a short time to get there

I'm east bound, just watch 'ole' Bandit run.

    Em                              C
Old Smokey's got them ears on, he's hot on your trail
       A            B7                  Em
And he ain't gonna' rest 'til you're in jail
               Em
So, you gotta' dodge him, you gotta' duck him
           C
you gotta' keep that diesel truckin'
     A                                B7
just put that hammer down and give it hell
