Are you hanging up a stocking on your wall?

It's the time that every Santa has a ball
        C                G
Does he ride a red nosed reindeer?
        C               G
Does he turn up on his sleigh?
          Am              C         Dsus4   D
Do the fairies keep him sober for a day?

Are you sure you got the room to spare inside?
          C             G
Does your granny always tell ya
         C                 G
That the old songs are the best?
          Am              C                      Dsus4   D
Yet she's up and rock and rollin' with the rest.

What will your daddy do
                  Dm

kissin' Santa Claus? Ah ah

Are you hoping that the snow will start to fall?
       C                         G
Do you slide up and down the hillside
     C              G
In a buggy you have made?
         Am             C                      Dsus4  D
When you land upon your head then you been slayed.
