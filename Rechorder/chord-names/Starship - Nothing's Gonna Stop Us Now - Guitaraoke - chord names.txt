F#                      D#m
Looking in your eyes I see a paradise
     B
This world that I've found
        C#
is too good to be true
F#
Standing here beside you,
D#m
want so much to give you
     B                         C#
This love in my heart that I'm feeling for you
 
F#                        D#m
  Let 'em say we're crazy,   I don't care about that
B
  Put your hand in my hand, baby,
C#
 don't ever look back
F#                        D#m
  Let the world around us  just fall apart
B                              E/G#           C#
  Baby we can make it if we're heart to heart
 
           F#
And we can build this dream together,
D#m
standing strong forever
B                       C#
Nothing's gonna stop us now
            F#
And if this world runs out of lovers,
D#m
we'll still have each other
B                        C#                       E/G#  C#
Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us now
 
F#
I'm so glad I found you
D#m
I'm not gonna lose you
    B                    C#
Whatever it takes I will stay here with you
F#
Take it to the good times,
D#m
see it through the bad times
    B                     C#
Whatever it takes is what I'm gonna do
 
F#                         D#m
  Let 'em say we're crazy,   what do they know?
B
  Put your arms around me, baby,
C#
don't ever let go
F#                        D#m
  Let the world around us  just fall apart
B                              E/G#           C#
  Baby we can make it if we're heart to heart
 
           F#
And we can build this dream together,
D#m
standing strong forever
B                       C#
Nothing's gonna stop us now
            F#
And if this world runs out of lovers,
D#m
we'll still have each other
B                        C#                      E/G#
Nothing's gonna stop us, nothing's gonna stop us now
 
F#    A#m                B
Ooh, all that I need is you
G#m             F#
All that I ever need
    A#m                B
And all that I want to do
   G#m               B             C#
Is hold you forever, ever and ever,
 
C#
